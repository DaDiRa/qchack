### The Ising Model
The Ising model describes a chain of spins that act like magnetic dipoles. The ferromagnetic interactions between neighboring spins create a system that tries to settle on the lowest energy state. Therefore, the energy of the system is described by a Hamiltonian.

## Transverse field Ising Model

[The transverse field Ising Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse-field_Ising_model) can be described by a two-state system where each state corresponds to the value of the spin. Due to non-commuting observables when the transverse field is introduced, a quantum approach is needed in order to calculate the Hamiltonian of the system. We can therefore match the number of the spins that create the chain to a
